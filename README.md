After installing node open the terminal and go to the folder of your theme.
Type the following below to install all the dependencies needed for this project.
```
npm i
```
After all the packages have been installed, type in `npm run watch` to startup the Webpack process.
This will startup a few of the processes like Autoprefixing CSS, bundling JS and / or other tasks you might add.
